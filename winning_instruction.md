To maximize your chances of winning in Track 3: Build a Full dApp Using 1inch APIs, your project should hit the minimum success criteria, add polished UX, and demonstrate a clear vision. Here's your complete checklist:

🥇 🧨 Must-Have: MVP Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
These are bare minimum to even be considered for prizes.
✅ 1. Integration with 1inch Fusion+ APIs
* Use Fusion+ intent creation (/intent)
* Use quote API for estimating swap outcomes
* Either simulate or show real resolver fulfillment
* Bonus: Show use of resolver API, token info, etc.
✅ 2. Create & Store Recurring Swap Intents
* User can define:
    * Source/Target token
    * Frequency
    * Amount
    * Fee tolerance
* Intent is stored (in-memory or DB)
✅ 3. Recurring Execution Logic (Backend)
* Simulated or real cron job/BullMQ job runner
* Triggers investment intents at defined frequency
* Shows logs: success, failed, skipped
* Bonus: Retry logic on failure
✅ 4. Live Portfolio Tracking UI
* Aggregate token balances from wallets
* Show:
    * Total invested
    * ROI %
    * Allocations (pie chart)
    * Investment history
* Bonus: Time series chart
✅ 5. Gamification Layer
* XP system (e.g., 10 XP per swap)
* Streak counter (e.g., “3-day streak”)
* Basic SVG badges/milestones
* Optional: Leaderboard (mocked/local)

💅 High-Impact: Polish & Presentation (What Makes You Stand Out)
🌟 6. Clear, Clean UX
* Use Next.js + Tailwind for a polished frontend
* Modern, minimal UI (clean layout, spacing, font hierarchy)
* Smooth wallet connection (MetaMask only is fine for MVP)
🎥 7. Great Demo Video (1–3 min)
* Start with a 1-liner pitch ("We help DeFi users automate their micro-investments across chains—gasless and gamified.")
* Show wallet connection → intent creation → portfolio → gamification
* Mention clearly that you’re using 1inch Fusion+ APIs
* Include team name, GitHub link, and what’s next
🧠 8. Good GitHub Structure
* Clean README:
    * What problem you solve
    * Demo link
    * How to run locally
    * Fusion+ endpoints used
* Commented code
* Screenshots or architecture diagram (bonus)

⚙️ Bonus Features That Can Push You into Top Tier
🚀 9. Resolver Transparency Dashboard
* Table of:
    * Resolver address
    * Time of execution
    * Fee paid
    * Swap hash
* Bonus: Resolver stats over time
📢 10. Notification Layer
* Email or Telegram notification after:
    * Successful investment
    * Streak broken
* Even simulated notifications help show vision
🌉 11. Multi-chain Token Swap Flexibility
* Support for multiple chains (Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)
* User can pick source + destination chain
* Shows quotes and resolver fee impact

❌ Things NOT to Waste Time On
* Full auth system (OAuth, login) → unnecessary for MVP
* Full NEAR support → 1inch doesn’t support it yet
* On-chain staking/farming post swap → not needed for MVP
* Mobile app → focus on web UI

🏁 Summary: What Judges Are Looking For
Area	Weight	Your Goal
Use of 1inch APIs	⭐⭐⭐⭐	Deep integration with Fusion+, not shallow usage
UX/UI	⭐⭐⭐	Clean, clear, gamified UI
Realism	⭐⭐⭐⭐	Show it could be used today, even if simulated
Creativity	⭐⭐	Gamification, recurring intent = good edge
Execution	⭐⭐⭐⭐	Clean code, working demo, not just slideware
